    <h1 id="Merchant-Layer-Before-Going-Deeper"><a href="#Merchant-Layer-Before-Going-Deeper" class="headerlink" title="Merchant Layer -Before Going Deeper"></a>Merchant Layer -Before Going Deeper</h1><p>As they farewelled the MPG, they decided to go straight to the palace, whoever called them, they will not stop. But, before the rush, they need to rest for a minute, they don’t want to lost time, so they went to Somayeh’s personal space, “I want to give a name to this space, since we learned and read in here, how  ‘bout call it classroom. “ said Somayeh.</p>
<p>“It’s your space, you decide, by the way, I think it’s cool, “ said Adrina. Ricky also nodded to agree.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s look at the book again and see if there is more information,” said Ricky.</p>
<p>“OK”</p>
<p>“OK”</p>
<p>As Ricky opened the book, the weird light pop out again, this time, not so bright as last time, but this weird green light made them confused.</p>
<p>“This weird light appeared again,” said Somayeh.</p>
<p>“It’s just Magic and just read,” said Adrina.</p>
<p>“Adrina, why you are so angry these days,” asked Somayeh,</p>
<p>“You, and also you!” As Adrina pointed to Ricky.</p>
<p>“You two always put the important thing on his or yours shoulders, and I never have the responsibility to keep something nor the opportunity to do something, if there is someone writing a story for us, they will just write,<em>Ricky and Somayeh, not ADRINA</em>!” said Adrina angrily,”You guys forget I’m the sister of Marie, I’m the one the most shocked and dismay, why you and you seems as sad as a bird who lost it’s mom, I’m the one who always sad, these days I’m extremely sad because you two, you guys even don’t care a thing for me, no one said a word like <em>are you okay</em>  like the time I’m also in the water, I’m also near drowned, but no one save me, I use my magic to pull me up in order to survive, you don’t even know what I experienced and what I like or not, you just randomly give jobs that I don’t like, I’m way sad than you two, and you two make me even more sad than before,” said Adrina emotionally.</p>
<p>“Okay, we are sorry, I really don’t know you are sister of Marie, and I really didn’t notice you are almost drowned, I see you swim toward the land, so I go to save Somayeh, I’m really sorry, I know you don’t like talk with people that you are not familiar with, you don’t like to talk with little kids or big kids, apparently, you just don’t like to talk with anyone,” said Ricky.</p>
<p>“Thanks fo your help, I feel like I’m better now,” said Adrina.</p>
<p>“Now try to talk more and don’t be shy, people always a little shy when they met new people that they don’t know,” said Ricky.</p>
<p>“You can sleep here if you want, you seem tired enough of the thing now,” said Somayeh with deep concern.</p>
<p>As Adrina slept down, she had a dream again:</p>
<p><em>She was in that big house again and she open the window and the door, animals like birds, insects all appeared in the big big forest, and also her friends, Ricky and Somayeh helped to open several windows, and also the doors that was not only the front door, and she was ‘bothered’ now, but she feels happy enough</em>.</p>
<p>She woke up with happiness plant in her heart, “Adrina, are you okay? We saw you crying in your dream, is there some sad things going on?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m fine, but I don’t believe that I cried, I’m happy in that dream,</p>
<p>“ replied Adrina,</p>
<p>They opened the book again and continue reading the thing about Nuno the king ：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nuno, is a mysterious king that often don’t like to appear in most people live, people don’t know where is him for a while, but, they know there is a king somewhere in the whole layer, although merchant layer is the smallest layer in Baquran, people can’t find him for a while, but the mysterious  organization MPG find the king and they never tell anybody. Nuno is one of the old seven kings&#39;s grandson, he is the grandson of the Kind God, which he think is the best. People say that he should be kind as his grand parents say, we should be kind, also if you have enough time and power to do something to make crimes disappear, please do it, or else, we won’t feel that good at the heaven. In Baquran, most religious people believe the special religion that only appeared in Baquran, The Guiben religion, which is somehow most likely a mix of Christianity and Buddhism，they believe there is heaven and hell, so most people think the king is too mysterious, and he should be like the other kings, appear in social medias and don’t talk with people privately. The people often think the weakness of the king might be people don’t listen to the king and be loyal to other layers and no one will appear in the merchant layer, now, people were most going to other layers, the populations decrease very bad and most people go out, instead of live nor go in to the layer. So the king was trying to help the thing by himself, by turning and turning the time several times, but, the time he changed only affects the people or person he want to change, other people won’t be affected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Nuno is a <em>descendant</em> of the god of kind? Okay, he better be kind, or else we need to be kind,” said Ricky，”By the way, we are not sure about the world ideology or the worldview in this world, but I can’t find it in the book,”</p>
<p>“Let me try.” said Somayeh, as she pointed the wand to the book, and she said: “world view!”.</p>
<p>The magic book flips by itself and it turned to page 3098, which was all talking about world views and about the world. “WOW, your magic is good, I can only put some fire on my hand,” said Ricky as he put a dark, purple fire with low temperature appeared on his hand, Adrina didn’t want to be the last again so she spawned out water and make the fire vanished.</p>
<p>“Okay, stop competing for this.” as Somayeh read the story about world views out loud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This world was nothing at first, but the gods created the lands, water and even us, also the animals, on this world, everyone need to be strong to protect themselves, strong things eat the weak things, the weak things eat more weak things, the world works like that and everyone already sick of that world pattern in the world, once, the early humans try to fight the beasts that often destroy their happy <em>Afternoon life</em>, they carried spears, try to throw at them, but it all didn’t work at all. Thus, they were all ate by the beasts, before the big war between the nature and human beings, the gods made predictions about the wars and which species will finally survive, several gods made predictions on human beings, because they were the smartest in the species, but the big error that they make really frustrated the gods and their consequences of lose is they might not be the leader of the whole heaven(as they believed that the gods were appeared and lived in heaven, or accurately, on heaven) or even death, they don’t want to lost so easily, so they gave the human beings magic and armors, if they don’t have the match, the history will go to another direction. As the god thought, human beings won the big match <em>Below the heaven</em> and the gods won the match on the heaven. The gods that voted for the other species were sentenced to the world to be either a human (which is not bad) or an animal. But, human beings were too proud and they made most things no matter with the gods, and more and more <em>scientist</em> appeared and encourage other people to believe science instead of gods and religions. That made the gods super mad and finally gave the <em>divine punishment.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Emmm, so that’s why even we didn’t come or born from the country but we still know magic?” Asked Ricky.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I never thought is the gods gave the people magic and armors.” said Somayeh.</p>
