    <h1 id="Merchant-layer-fight-against-the-King"><a href="#Merchant-layer-fight-against-the-King" class="headerlink" title="Merchant layer - fight against the King"></a>Merchant layer - fight against the King</h1><p>They walked toward the palace as they look for a lot of special plants, because Adrina was learning about plants, so if they can’t find the plant, Adrina will.</p>
<p>They reached the palace, they saw golden walls surrounding it, a big gate that was painted red, and even a big thing that show you that here is the place of the king. The palace was so huge that they even didn’t saw the whole thing, “Why is it so huge, and no one noticing the palace at all” asked Ricky,”I guess is the spider that made them fear to go further” said Somayeh, Adrina nodded,”Let’s go and knock the gate”</p>
<p>They went to the gate and knocked on the door,”Anybody here?” asked Somayeh, the king heard the sound and he go out, an old man with a big crown on his head ,”You defeat the fog and spider? Is already 30 years and no one beat them at all, thank you by helping me about the monsters in front of my palace,” said the king, “come on in, and I will talk with you,” as he lead they into the palace,”Where did you got that,” as he pointed to Somayeh’s neck,”Someone gave to me,” replied Somayeh,”You know what is that right? “ said the king surprisedly,”It’s just a whistle, but it might got some magic, because it once save our life,”replied Somayeh,”Is it important though?Why you seems so surprise and glance at me”.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s one of the <em>past legend</em>. Which is seven things that the seven god created for human, one of them is your whistle, and I believe you are joking that someone gave it to you because it’s almost extinct for decades,” said the king,”I am collecting those in order to get as much power as the gods, there is a old legend that tells: if you have the seven things together, you can kill the gods and be the gods, so, sorry, even I admire your braveness, I still need to get the whistle,” said the king. As he got his sword out and chop toward Ricky, suddenly Somayeh feel that shock again, she don’t know what to do, is she going to see another friend’s death? Or she is going to go for it, I guess she choose the second one. She used magic shield to bounce the sword off,”powerful magic, but, this time, you are going to loose,” as the king wave the sword and get many small swords out and pushed all to them, but the shield still hold the mess, suddenly, Adrina shot a big arrow and it exploded to small pieces before it reaches,”this little arrow can’t kill me, too weak!” as he throw a small sword and fled over, the shield was disappearing slowly, the knife almost reached Adrina’s head and she suddenly used her only skill: vanish, she vanished and she appeared at the back, she shot another one when the king thought Adrina died, Ricky also jumped and chop at him, as Somayeh blew the whistle. Suddenly, Ricky stopped, arrow stopped, the sound of whistle also stopped, “Forgot he can stop time,” said Ricky, but he can’t move. As the sound of clock appeared, they were turn back when they started to fight, they keep fighting and fighting until they found out it can’t kill him nor he can kill them, they were just repeating and repeating the same process as always,”I have a plan, cover me!” said Ricky as he went in to the classroom, and then he went exactly where the king was, and he went out, suddenly, he was at the back, he quickly chop to his head, he made it, suddenly, blood all pumped out and several bones appeared,”Ricky! You got it!” as Somayeh use magic  to move the dead body into the magical space,”lets see what he got!” said Somayeh as they went into the place, they saw a big bag in the broken place of the body, it’s filled with different weird things, “Did he just say he is collecting the legends? Maybe this is it,” said Adrina, as she picked up those things.”Okay, I guess we have 3 legends now, a whistle, a marble, and a magic wand… wait, Somayeh, you can use the wand, if you think you can,” said Ricky, as he put those thing away and gave the wand to Somayeh, her old one seems already a bit broken when she was maintaining the magic shield. “We should read about the legends since we never heard it before,” as Somayeh flipped the book to the page 429: </p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="Past-Legends-The-God"><a href="#Past-Legends-The-God" class="headerlink" title="Past Legends, The God"></a>Past Legends, The God</h1><p>Past legends are things that were made by the time the big fight between the gods, they are actually just weapon that each god had at first, then they find out they are not able to use it because they are to powerful, so they send the legends to the 7 strongest species. And of course, each weapon represents a god, the whistle, which represents the hope god, the wand, which represents the kind god, the marble, which represents the friendship god, the infinite water bucket, which represents the sadness god, the drum, which represents the thankful god, a rose, which represents the beauty god, finally, a chair, which represents the calm chair, the whistle, which symbolize hope, the marble, made the god think of playing marble with friends, so it symbolizes friendship. The wand, which helps people that had problem with health and physical injure, which symbolizes kind of saving others’ life. The infinite bucket, represents infinite crying, which symbolizes sadness. The drum, when you play in the thanksgiving, which symbolizes thank, and the rose, which symbolizes beauty. And finally the chair, which let you calm when you sit on it, which represents calm.</p>
<p>Each legend is a theme of the god, or a message that they want their people know, it might be a lesson, or power, or even just a chair, it don’t directly represents the gods’ power, but it affects the people a lot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Hey, I found the key!” as Somayeh saw a golden key shining in the moonlight, she picked it up and showed to her friends.”Okay, now we can go to the layer gate now,” said Ricky,”Yeah, I agree, there is no reason we should stay here since we’ve been a murderer,” said Adrina with a hilarious way.</p>
<p>They went to the layer door showed in the map, “Oh yeah, I remember we say that we are going to build a territory for the MPG right?” asked Adrina, “Yes, so we should get some building materials,” said Ricky,”No problem, I got it, I can use magic,” said Somayeh, “Okay, I think we should put the key in the hole,” as Ricky putted the key in the weird hole, it fit well, but the gate open with no sound, they thought it might not be any sound there so it don’t had a sound, as someone pushed them into the gate, “Who pushed me!!!!”. As Jake stared at the empty gate, he said, “Bye, you guys like to say word that are useless, too slow.” </p>
