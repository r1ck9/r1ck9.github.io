    <h1 id="Living-Layer-First-View"><a href="#Living-Layer-First-View" class="headerlink" title="Living Layer - First View"></a>Living Layer - First View</h1><p>The gate squished them into the living layer, they landed successfully, not like last time, this time, they landed on land rather than a river. They landed on a typical rainforest. There were bears, birds, and a lot of animals there, not like other layers, this layer seems full of live and it’s lively, it’s bright, lively, rather than dark, monsters everywhere. As it said in the book, other normal animals(animals on Earth) “Who pushed us into the gate?” asked Ricky,”We won’t know, I guess it is someone who wanted us to go to the living layer quickly,” </p>
<p>“Never mind, let’s see this layer for a second, it is exactly another world than the last one,” said Ricky, “Whoaa!!!” Ricky yelled, A wild bear pounced over them, almost crushed them into the ground,”I finally know why the MPG didn’t build a territory here,” said Adrina, she was scared of the bear so much. So as Somayeh, she was also afraid of wild animals. “We need to leave here quickly,”. They plan to go to the East. They walked and walked, try to find something that consist human involve in, or, try to find some people. Living layer is a wild place that no-one want to live, and that’s also why the MPG don’t have a territory in the living layer. It’s too dangerous to stay anywhere at living layer because the animals immediately knew where you are and come to catch you as fast as the light. Even though the king of living layer, or practically a leader of the animals, was supposed to be fair, kind person that care about everything in this world(well, only for his own layer I guess) “We can’t find anything, we should look at the book for clues and about the king, we might need to ask the king for help.” said Somayeh</p>
<p>“NO, definitely NOT, I don’t want to get eaten or deal with a lion or tiger or something” said Adrina,”Well, if you are going to deal with a lion, I will help you, but don’t expect me to save all of you,”</p>
<p>“Okay, we won’t deal with a lion! The king is the descendant of the kind god, so he will be kind and helpful right?” said Ricky, “Just calm down, you need to face the problem, we should face it together. It’s easier to defeat anything when you’re ready to,” said Somayeh, looking at Adrina.</p>
<p>“Stop looking me, okay, I won’t be scared!” said Adrina, and her face turned into a tomato, she feel the friendship again, that friendship she wanted so much before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Adrina, why don’t you got a friend” said Marie, “I just don’t like to talk with others, it make me feel hard and I just want me to do by myself” answered Adrina. She doesn’t get a lot of friends in her whole primary school, she think it’s useless to put effort on communicating and hang out. She didn’t feel that lonely, therefore, she like to work with herself. She has faced a lot of problems, but she fixed it all, she enjoy lonely, she once had wanted friend. But, her friend always hang out for other friends and almost forget Adrina, Adrina already think it’s normal, she close her self ever since. She sat in a little house, enjoy the life of one person, suddenly, she felt lonely. Never, she never had felt lonely, that moment, she grown, she turn into a person that knew what is the purpose of life. “Working, achieving goals, As a TEAM” Adrina work as a team ever since, she communicate with others a lot and often make others enjoy talking with her, she feel friendship, and even happy, a special joy that is not lonely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adrina’s heart was happy and joyful, Ricky, Somayeh, Marie, changed her a lot, the most important thing, she opened her self, she is not self-enclosed anymore. She chose to be open minded, and, she chose the right track.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Somayeh pull her back from the imagination(actually thinking truth, not fake)”What are you thinking? Adrina?” asked Somayeh, “Nada” answered her.</p>
<p>They turn the book and find the page of leaders and kings.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="About-the-king-of-the-living-layer"><a href="#About-the-king-of-the-living-layer" class="headerlink" title="About the king of the living layer"></a>About the king of the living layer</h2><p>The king of the living layer is called Aiden, he is a mixture of human and deer. Human torso with a deer head and deer leg. It’s kind of a horse man, but he is very kind. He is the descendent of the kind god. Animals were weak before, and he often saw animals that are injured or killed by human and other species. He healed a lot of animals in the forest before, when he was the king, he is afraid of that the “citizen” will injure, so he use magic to make the animals can’t be touch or even try to touch. People have touched the animal will burn up and turn to dust in a millisecond. There are about 4,000,000 people that died under the hand of Aiden, he think that’s not right to kill, so he made the animal not been killed but there is no punishment for touching it. Actually, he got “Detention” of the god because he killed so many humans. There are only about not even a billion people in the world before, and he almost killed half of them. So he never killed a person since that.</p>
<p>He lived in the North part of the living layer, and he often look around in the layer to see if any animals need help or even people that need help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> “Okay, he don’t eat people, that’s fine,” said Adrina.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the North!!!” said Somayeh, “We need to find him, maybe we can saw him around the way we went to there if we are lucky,” as they started to go to the North, Somayeh spawned a carpet that can fly and made them to the North,”WOW, it’s so beautiful looking from above,” said Ricky,”Wait, there is a red house, let’s see if that is!” said Ricky as Somayeh made the carpet slower and slower until it reached the ground, the red house is so different other than the whole forest, like a red blood in a green vessel. They went toward the red house a little bit with cautious.”Finally! We finally found something that seem like the house of Aiden,” said Somayeh,”Let me knock the door,” as she went toward the door. She knocked the door twice,”Anyone here?” as she asked, she found out that the door was actually unlocked. She opened the door, fog and spiders come out again,”Woaaaa!” said Somayeh, she ran back to her friends and yelled:”Prepare to fight!” she showed the magic circle and protected them, Ricky went into the house in a hurry”I will killed it!” as he disappeared in the dark of the night, suddenly, fire come out from the top of the house, burning the whole house down, as the fire appeared the fog and the spider all ran away. Ricky ran out and yelled “What is that fire! IS that YOU Somayeh?” </p>
<p>“No, someone else shot a fire arrow and burned it down” replied Somayeh angrily, she is mad at Ricky because he rushed into the house.</p>
<p>Aiden looked at them at the other side of the house,”Hmmmm, such a interesting group of kids.” and he walked away.</p>
