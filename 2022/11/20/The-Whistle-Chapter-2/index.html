    <h2 id="Quick-React"><a href="#Quick-React" class="headerlink" title="Quick React"></a>Quick React</h2><p>As Joe finished his speech about the injection, people with white clothes and masks came. They took Somayeh and the rest of them to the center of the academy. Which was the part called injection special zone, they lined up as a defile and quickly stepped into the zone. They were happy, and don’t have any fears because they think it is only a small shot. Also, they can get $100 without any working at home or doing chores signed from their mom. As they walked to the center, Somayeh just noticed that her 2 years friend Marie was in the line too, and also Ricky and Adrina. Of course they all get pulled by the special concert, but they were talking with each other as finally find people that they knew before: “Somayeh??? Why are you here?So as you Marie?”Asked Ricky and Adrina, with deeply confuse? </p>
<p>“We were squished into a big hole and we transported to the lab.” Somayeh and Marie replied.</p>
<p>“So as We!” Ricky and Adrina yelled.</p>
<p>“Okay,  I don’t think this is a good experiment, so take this, it will clear all the effects on your body, after they give you a shot, drink this before it hit your nerves. “Said Ricky.</p>
<p>“Okay, we will drink this, thank you for telling us,”  they replied.</p>
<p>As they were in the line waiting for a shot,  the system said from above,”#370124 please come and take a shot.” </p>
<p>Somayeh was still talking with her friends and she didn’t noticed that the system was calling her,”#370124 is your number! Go, Somayeh,” said Adrina with concern.Somayeh quickly ran to the shot “place” and take the special drink that was filled in a coke bottle, so that people will think they are just drinking coke. As she went up to the man with white cloths, all the people there were looking at her attitude and react from the injection. The staff pushed the needle’s head into Somayeh’s arm, she didn’t felt that painful, but it really scared her, because the needle was pretty long. “finished, #370125, please come.”said the system from above, everyone put their breath down, and then, she quickly drank the <em>coke</em> and ran to the <em>finish area</em> to rest.</p>
<p>Then, it was Adrina’s turn, successfully, she passed it too. So as Ricky, but, when it was Marie’s turn. She was scared and refused to take it, but, she was be told that, ever since she agreed that ‘law’ she can’t regret to take it. So they still put the shot in when she was scared, that made her more scared and finally collapsed and fainted to the ground. That made the other <em>testers</em> scared and refused to do the test. They took away her and ended the big mess of injections. </p>
<p>“Oh no,”said Ricky with worries,”she forget to drink the thing I gave it to her, and they might find it and make us never getting out of this weird place.”</p>
<p>“It better don’t cause a mess, well the most cruel thing I can think of is they make us turn into zombies or ghosts.”said Adrina, laughing with Somayeh.</p>
<p>As they made the people out of the lab, Marie, escaped the place they kept her and ran to Somayeh,”I’m turn into a zombie, go run, we don’t have time, save me after everything ends!”said Marie with full fear.</p>
<p>“No, we are gonna save you, you are our friends, you can’t turn into a zombie! You better be kidding about this,”said Somayeh.</p>
<p>“Go, they can’t control it, it was not Joe’s fault, everyone in this world is turning to zombie, except you guys, you are the only hope, and the last hope within this world,”said Marie,”Go to the center of Baquran and get something called Diggela, it is a special plant that will fix us, and turn us back to human.”</p>
<p>As Marie ran away from them, she looked exactly like a zombie, green skins, and red eyes, but with a normal human brain.</p>
<p>“Joe, he will keep me safe.”yelled Marie with the last hope.</p>
<p>At that moment, Somayeh totally shocked.She can’t believed that her 2 years friend turned to a zombie, she can’t accepted the facts now standing in her head, fighting and fighting. World is nothingness, literally nothing. Black? White? No, there was no color at all, nothing appeared in her head, everything burned down in her mind, the buildings, the labs. Everything was nothing now, no one exist in that nothing, nothing, <em>nothing at all</em>.</p>
<p>Somayeh and her friend miserably walked through the lab and went out, looking for alive human, I guess. They find Joe, fine and nice, standing there with a huge smile, like a doll that always smiled. The angry and furious crowded in upon her mind. “Kill him, turn him to her zombie!” As they thought. </p>
<p>Flashbacks appeared in her mind.</p>
<p><em>“Hey, Somayeh, let’s play LAVA!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Hey, Somayeh, what did you got on your test?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Hey, Somayeh, who is your best friend? Is that me?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Hey, Somayeh, gave me a candy, please!”</em></p>
<p>“NO, let he make Marie safe and happy, he is the only one that can help us now, we can’t kill him “ said Somayeh calmly.</p>
<p>“<em>You want to kill me?</em>“ said Joe laughing so hard that his sound vibrated in the big lab.</p>
<p>“Now I don’t”</p>
<p>“Did she tell you that she can be turned back?” Asked Joe.</p>
<p>“Yes, what about it, she tells us every thing.”</p>
<p>“Okay, then you can start you adventure finding the plant, and what I will tell you is, I don’t mean to do that, sorry if I scared you, but the thing is, Baquran already turns to a hunted city, there was zombies everywhere, the test is fine, but something went wrong on her body, I don’t why neither, but I know that she is unique, so I will keep her safe when you guys are having a big adventure! And I will help you as much as I can.” As he said, he gave us a little box, when something went wrong, open it, the problem will solve, well that was what he said, they didn’t yet believe Joe so much. But they don’t have ideas for now, so they are going to take that as a plan…</p>
